# Transgender Housing Relief

 The Trans Housing Relief project is to reboot and enhance the functionality of the now defunct Trans Housing Network. The primary aim is to provide a platform for trans, intersex and gender nonconforming people to search for and offer emergency housing, and secondarily to offer the same service for more permanent housing. We will be using Node.js, React, Express, and MongoDB/Mongoose to complete this project.
